      - If music be the food of love, play on;
      - Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
      - The appetite may sicken, and so die.
      - 'That strain again! it had a dying fall:'
      - O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
      - That breathes upon a bank of violets,
      - 'Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:'
      - '''Tis not so sweet now as it was before.'
      - O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
      - That, notwithstanding thy capacity
      - Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
      - Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
      - But falls into abatement and low price,
      - 'Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy'
      - That it alone is high fantastical.

      - The hart.
    - speaker: ORSINO
      lines:
      - 'Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:'
      - O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
      - Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
      - That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
      - And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
      - E'er since pursue me.
      - '[Enter VALENTINE]'
      - How now! what news from her?
    - speaker: VALENTINE-12
      lines:
      - So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
      - 'But from her handmaid do return this answer:'
      - The element itself, till seven years' heat,
      - Shall not behold her face at ample view;
      - But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
      - And water once a day her chamber round
      - 'With eye-offending brine: all this to season'
      - A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
      - And lasting in her sad remembrance.
    - speaker: ORSINO
      lines:
      - O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
      - To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
      - How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
      - Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
      - That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
      - These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
      - Her sweet perfections with one self king!
      - 'Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:'
      - Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.

    - speaker: SeaCaptain
      lines:
      - This is Illyria, lady.
    - speaker: VIOLA
      lines:
      - And what should I do in Illyria?
      - My brother he is in Elysium.
      - 'Perchance he is not drown''d: what think you, sailors?'
    - speaker: SeaCaptain
      lines:
      - It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
    - speaker: VIOLA
      lines:
      - O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
    - speaker: SeaCaptain
      lines:
      - 'True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,'
      - Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
      - When you and those poor number saved with you
      - Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
      - Most provident in peril, bind himself,
      - Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
      - To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
      - Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
      - I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
      - So long as I could see.
    - speaker: VIOLA
      lines:
      - 'For saying so, there''s gold:'
      - Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
      - Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
      - The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
    - speaker: SeaCaptain
      lines:
      - Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
      - Not three hours' travel from this very place.
    - speaker: VIOLA
      lines:
      - Who governs here?
    - speaker: SeaCaptain

      - What is the name?
    - speaker: SeaCaptain
      lines:
      - Orsino.
    - speaker: VIOLA
      lines:
      - 'Orsino! I have heard my father name him:'
      - He was a bachelor then.
    - speaker: SeaCaptain
      lines:
      - And so is now, or was so very late;
      - For but a month ago I went from hence,
      - And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
      - What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
      - That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
    - speaker: VIOLA
      lines:
      - What's she?
    - speaker: SeaCaptain
      lines:
      - A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
      - That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
      - In the protection of his son, her brother,
      - 'Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,'
      - They say, she hath abjured the company
      - And sight of men.
    - speaker: VIOLA
      lines:
      - O that I served that lady
      - And might not be delivered to the world,
      - Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
      - What my estate is!
    - speaker: SeaCaptain
      lines:
      - That were hard to compass;
      - Because she will admit no kind of suit,
      - No, not the duke's.
    - speaker: VIOLA
      lines:
      - There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
      - And though that nature with a beauteous wall
      - Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
      - I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
      - With this thy fair and outward character.
      - I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
      - Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
      - For such disguise as haply shall become
      - 'The form of my intent. I''ll serve this duke:'
      - 'Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:'
      - It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
      - And speak to him in many sorts of music
      - That will allow me very worth his service.
      - What else may hap to time I will commit;
      - Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
    - speaker: SeaCaptain
      lines:
      - 'Be you his eunuch, and your mute I''ll be:'
      - When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

    - speaker: MARIA

      - By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
      - 'nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great'

    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - Why, let her except, before excepted.
    - speaker: MARIA
      lines:
      - Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
      - limits of order.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - 'Confine! I''ll confine myself no finer than I am:'
      - these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
      - 'these boots too: an they be not, let them hang'
      - themselves in their own straps.
    - speaker: MARIA
      lines:
      - 'That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard'
      - my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
      - knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
    - speaker: belch

      - Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
    - speaker: MARIA
      lines:
      - Ay, he.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
    - speaker: MARIA
      lines:
      - What's that to the purpose?
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
    - speaker: MARIA
      lines:
      - 'Ay, but he''ll have but a year in all these ducats:'
      - he's a very fool and a prodigal.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
      - viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
      - word for word without book, and hath all the good
      - gifts of nature.
    - speaker: MARIA
      lines:
      - 'He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that'
      - 'he''s a fool, he''s a great quarreller: and but that'
      - he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
      - hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
      - he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
      - that say so of him. Who are they?

      - They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
    - speaker: belch

      - 'With drinking healths to my niece: I''ll drink to'
      - her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
      - 'drink in Illyria: he''s a coward and a coystrill'
      - that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
      - o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!

      lines:
      - Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
      - her, woo her, assail her.
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
      - company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
    - speaker: MARIA
      lines:
      - Fare you well, gentlemen.
    - speaker: belch

      - An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
      - never draw sword again.
    - speaker: aguecheek

      - draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have

    - speaker: MARIA

      - Sir, I have not you by the hand.
    - speaker: aguecheek

      - Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
    - speaker: MARIA

      - your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?
    - speaker: MARIA

      - It's dry, sir.
    - speaker: aguecheek

      - 'Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can'
      - keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
    - speaker: MARIA
      lines:
      - A dry jest, sir.
    - speaker: aguecheek

      - Are you full of them?
    - speaker: MARIA

      - see thee so put down?
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
      - put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
      - 'than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a'
      - great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - No question.
    - speaker: aguecheek

      - An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
      - to-morrow, Sir Toby.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - Pourquoi, my dear knight?
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
      - bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
      - 'fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but'
      - followed the arts!
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - Why, would that have mended my hair?
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
      - hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
      - and spin it off.
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - 'Faith, I''ll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece'
      - will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
      - 'she''ll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.'
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - 'She''ll none o'' the count: she''ll not match above'
      - her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
      - have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
      - man.
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
      - strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
      - and revels sometimes altogether.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
      - degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
      - with an old man.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - Faith, I can cut a caper.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - And I can cut the mutton to't.
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
      - as any man in Illyria.
    - speaker: belch
      lines:
      - Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
      - these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
      - take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
      - thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
      - a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
      - so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
      - dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
      - I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
      - leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
    - speaker: aguecheek
      lines:
      - Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
